**Basics of Python for Data Science**

This GitHub repository supports the course *Basics of Python for Data Science*, an introductory course on Python that is offered within the <a href="https://dottorato.psy.unipd.it/en">PhD program in Psychological Sciences</a> *(University of Padova)*. Although R is more extensively used for statistical analysis and data science within this PhD program, familiarity with Python is important for different purposes. These include advanced machine learning application, working with deep learning models, computational efficiency in some scenarios, programming experiments, or just knowing a little bit of a language that is widely demanded in industry and business contexts.

Throughout the course, we will explore the Python development environment, practice with common data structures and the essential concepts of programming, and introduce the fundamentals of data visualization and machine learning. Upon request, the course may also cover more advanced topics, such as the use of deep learning and language models from Hugging Face or OpenAI, or basic experiment programming.

Students are encouraged to look at this online book available on GitHub: <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook//" target="_blank">***Python Data Science Handbook***</a>. Those interested in deepening their knowledge are recommended to buy a copy of it.
