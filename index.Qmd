## About This Course

This is a short (10 hours) introductory course on <a href="https://www.python.org/" target=_blank>**Python**</a> that is offered within the <a href="https://dottorato.psy.unipd.it/en" target="_blank">PhD program in Psychological Sciences</a> *(University of Padova)*. R is more extensively used for statistical analysis and data science in this PhD program, but familiarity with Python is useful for different purposes, including advanced machine learning applications, deep learning models, natural language processing, computational efficiency in some scenarios, and programming experiments. Also, Python is widely required in industry and business, so basic proficiency with it a valuable asset! No prerequisites, but having attended <a href="https://enricotoffalini.github.io/Basics-R/" target="_blank">*Basics of R for Data Science*</a> may greatly help (well, it is a mandatory course for our PhD students)

You are encouraged to look at this online book available on GitHub: <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook//" target="_blank">***Python Data Science Handbook***</a>

## Getting Started

Bookmark this course homepage to have a quick access to this material (<a href="https://enricotoffalini.github.io/Basics-Python/">https://enricotoffalini.github.io/Basics-Python/</a>). Then do this:

1.  **Install Python**: go to the official <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python download page</a> and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2.  **Install an IDE** *(Integrated Development Environment)*: Suggested IDEs are <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" target="_blank">Posit/**RStudio**</a> (which you should have already installed for the other courses; it also supports Python!) or <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/" target="_blank">**Spyder**</a>.
3.  **Test your local setup**: Make sure that your Python installation works; open your IDE of choice and run the following code in the console:

```{python, eval=F}
!pip install numpy # install package "numpy" from inside IDE

import numpy as np
np.random.normal(0,1,size=10)
```

If you get any errors when running the first line, try install the package via terminal with <br/> `pip install numpy`

4.  **Take a look at** <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Colab</a>: Some basic practice and exercises will be conducted on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">**Google Colab**</a> (you need to log in with a Google account), a free online environment for writing and running Python in the browser without any local installation.

## Course Topics

##### Introduction to the Python Environment and First Steps in Python

Getting started with Python; using IDEs and Colab; basic syntax; basic operations; creating and naming objects; installing packages and using functions; basic data structures (*list*, *tuple*, *dict*) and indexing.

##### Basics of Programming in Python

The essential programming concepts: conditional statements, loops, and custom functions in Python.

##### Entering the World of Data Science in Python: `pandas`, `numpy`, and more

Python core libraries for data science! We will manipulate tabular data with `pandas`, perform operations `numpy`; some basic machine learning and statistical analysis from `scikit-learn` and `statsmodels`.

##### A Bit on Fancy Topics?

Data visualization, machine learning, use of deep learning & language models from <a href="https://huggingface.co/" target="_blank">HuggingFace</a> ðŸ¤—, basic experiment programming - mostly upon request! That's truly why we want to use Python, after all.
