## About This Course

This is an introductory course on <a href="https://www.python.org/" target=_blank>**Python**</a> that is offered within the <a href="https://dottorato.psy.unipd.it/en">PhD program in Psychological Sciences</a> *(University of Padova)*. Although R is more extensively used for statistical analysis and data science within this PhD program, familiarity with Python is important for different purposes. These include advanced machine learning application, working with deep learning models, computational efficiency in some scenarios, programming experiments, or just knowing a little bit of a language that is widely demanded in industry and business contexts.

Students are encouraged to look at this online book available on GitHub: <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook//" target="_blank">***Python Data Science Handbook***</a>. Those interested in deepening their knowledge are recommended to buy a copy of it.
